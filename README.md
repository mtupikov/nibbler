## Description
**Nibbler** is yet another snake video game written in C++ including a major twist: dynamic libraries.

## Usage
Just execute `build.sh` and launch binary file with parameters.
`Usage: ./nibbler <width> <height>`

## Known bugs
**GLFW** library sometimes lags for input. IDK why, too lazy to debug this.

## TODO
Make it work for windows.
